# DISCLAIMBER
Do NOT use this harmfully, this is meant to show that batch doesn't have limits as to what it can do and be fun for testing

ALSO, if you're making a video then link this repo at the top of the description, or at the start of the video (hear the or? you can do either one! im not picky.)

# batch-virus
A batch-file (and one python file) virus. This is a WIP and only one file has been added so far (which isnt batch lol)

# Installation

Go to releases and download the zip, after that go in to a terminal, and run "(batchfilename) --" (make sure your in the directory of the file! (: )and then one of the following modes:

Trojan: Just runs itself quietly and installs some program
Ransomeware: (I dont actually accept payments) Locks down the computer
Creepy_Pasta_Malware: Kinda like no escape, or any other virus with a story
